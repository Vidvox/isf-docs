# ISF Reference Page

This reference contains a set of useful notes for writing GLSL shaders to meet the ISF Specification.

## Reference Pages

- [Automatically Created Variables, Uniforms and Constants](ref_variables)
- [Built-In Functions](ref_functions)
- [Multi-Pass Shaders and Persistent Buffers](ref_multipass)
- [ISF JSON Attributes](ref_json)
- [Converting Non-ISF GLSL shaders to ISF](ref_converting)
- [Change Log](ref_changes)
    
## Sample Files

- Here is a collection of simple test ISF files that demonstrate ISF's basic features.  These are test filters, they aren't intended to have signifcant creative use:
[ISF Test/Tutorial filters](http://vidvox.net/rays_oddsnends/ISF%20tests+tutorials.zip
- [Here's an installer](http://www.vidvox.net/rays_oddsnends/Vidvox%20ISF%20resources.pkg.zip) for over a hundred different ISF files, both images and filters.  The installer places them in /Library/Graphics/ISF where they can be accessed by all users.

## Additional Resources

- Many of the standard GLSL variables and functions described in this reference are further discussed in [The Book of Shaders Glossary](https://thebookofshaders.com/glossary/) section.
- The full [ISF Specification Page](https://github.com/mrRay/ISF_Spec/) contains detailed information for developers.
